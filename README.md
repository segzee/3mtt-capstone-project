Overview
This repository contains a Python script (train_model.py) for training, evaluating, and saving a Random Forest Regression model. The script includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and evaluation. The goal is to predict a target variable (Confirmed) using numeric and categorical features from a dataset.

The pipeline is designed for flexibility and modularity, allowing you to easily adapt it to different datasets and use cases.

Features
Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values in numeric columns.
Identifies and replaces outliers.
Encodes categorical features using One-Hot Encoding.
Scales numeric features using StandardScaler.
Model Training:

Implements a Random Forest Regressor as the predictive model.
Performs hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV.
Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R² Score
Model Saving:

Saves the trained model as a .pkl file for future use.
Requirements
Software
Python 3.8 or later
Python Libraries
The script requires the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
joblib
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
How to Use
1. Prepare Your Dataset
Ensure your dataset is in a CSV file format.
The dataset must contain the following:
Numeric Columns: Deaths, Recovered, Active, New cases, New deaths, New recovered, Confirmed last week, 1 week change, 1 week % increase.
Categorical Columns: WHO Region.
Target Column: Confirmed.
2. Update the File Path
In the train_model.py script, update the filepath variable with the path to your dataset:

python
Copy code
filepath = "path/to/your/dataset.csv"
3. Run the Script
Run the script in your terminal or IDE:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
4. Output
The script performs the following tasks:

Preprocesses the data and splits it into training and testing sets.
Tunes hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV.
Evaluates the model on both training and testing datasets.
Saves the best model to the models/ directory as random_forest_model.pkl.
Directory Structure
plaintext
Copy code
project/
├── train_model.py       # Main script
├── models/              # Directory where the trained model is saved
└── data.csv             # Example dataset (not included in the repo)
Evaluation Metrics
The script outputs the following metrics for both the training and testing datasets:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.
R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model (closer to 1 is better).
Customization
1. Modify Feature Columns
If your dataset contains different features, update the numeric_cols and categorical_cols lists in the script:

python
Copy code
numeric_cols = ['Your_Numeric_Column1', 'Your_Numeric_Column2']
categorical_cols = ['Your_Categorical_Column']
2. Change the Target Variable
Replace target with your desired target column name:

python
Copy code
target = 'Your_Target_Column'
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
Modify the parameter grid in the perform_hyperparameter_search function to include additional hyperparameters:

python
Copy code
param_dist = {
    'regressor__n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'regressor__max_depth': [None, 10, 20],
    'regressor__min_samples_split': [2, 5]
}
Key Functions
Function	Description
load_data(filepath)	Loads the dataset from a CSV file.
preprocess_data()	Handles missing values, outliers, and splits the data into train/test sets.
create_preprocessor()	Builds pipelines for numeric and categorical feature transformations.

Extending the Project
1. Deployment
The trained model can be deployed in production environments for making predictions. You can use frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to build an API around the model.

2. Visualization
Integrate libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize feature importance or predictions.

3. Additional Models
Replace the RandomForestRegressor with other models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) for comparison and experimentation.
